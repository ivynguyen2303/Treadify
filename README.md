# Description:
This project is a website that generates a playlist based on the artist the user inputs. We used Javascript to retrieve the data from the backend, HTML/CSS to display the data, and Python/Flask to build the backend. The playlist generator uses the Spotify API to get songs by an artist and recommends a treadmill speed depending on the song's BPM. The  playlist is sorted by the intensity of the BPM.

# Instructions
Using this web application is quite straightforward.

Once you download the repository, you then can locally run the file on your computer and input your artist of choice in the search bar.

[limitations: in lieu of connecting the application to a domain, we used ngrok; takes a local server and tunnels it to be accessible on other computers. the problem is that everytime the local machine has to restart the server, the link, that is hard coded in view.js, is changed. this is a problem because until we change the link in the file, the program halts in functionality.]
